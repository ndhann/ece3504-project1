## build instructions

Basically, run the following command from the root of the project folder after installing sbcl (https://www.sbcl.org/) from a package manager... or the website if you run windows (click on the green square on the download page)

``` sh
sbcl --load assembler.lisp --eval "(sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die \"myAssembler\" :toplevel #'main :executable t)"
```

What this does is load the source code into sbcl, then runs the command to generate an executable from it. If the above command doesnâ€™t work for any reason, first run `sbcl --load assembler.lisp`, then run the following command from the sbcl REPL: `(sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die "myAssembler" :toplevel #'main :executable t)`.

myAssembler in the above commands is the name of the output binary; change this as needed (on Windows, may need to change it to myAssembler.exe?).
